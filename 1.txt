Component is a piece of reusable code.
It is individual piece of code that has its own i/p, o/p and functionality.

Cannot write html in javascript without improting the react library.

To return multiple component, use- return(
						....
						)


If you want to pass an array or any thing from the parent to the child in the form of property, it can be done like
      <ContactList contact={contact}/>
Here we are passing the contact array as a property to the contact list as a property

The property can be accessed via the keyword props
const ContactList = (props) =>{
	...
}
